I love this project.  It is one of my favorites this semester.  Your proesentation was also fantastic!  There's a lot of potential here, and it would be wonderful to see you follow through on your plans to expand the language's capabilities.  One thing I was thinking about as you demoed this was the fact that sometimes an arpeggio is not played with uniform durations for each note.  An example the immediately comes to mind is The Animals' cover of "House of the Rising Sun" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS90B4sZf7U), which also has several instruments playing arpeggios.  Could you expand your language to handle music like that?  Before I had musician friends in middle school, I used to record myself playing arpeggios on a tape player for accompaniment.  I would have killed for a language like this!
